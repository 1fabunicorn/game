# Resnix

This is the starting out README for Nova's and Ben project

### This project's goal is a game. A game like no other. You are not prepared for this game.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Imagine when the linux kernel was released, it was made illegal worldwide.
The unix kernel was released already, so the binaries are out on the black market.
Trust few, bring down the governments from the inside with incriminating stuff they are doing.
Why else would they make this illegal???
