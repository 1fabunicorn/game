Shit. Ari was taken. He was the master of FTP management. We need a way of sharing linux freeware V 1.0 using an idea of mirrors.
This is so that the code is distributed, so if one goes down, more exist. Your task, if you choose to accept is to help with this project. You will need to keep up to date with vulnerabilities that could expose users downloading the software.
We thankfully have a man on the inside who will email you about these vulnerability the govâ€™t.
Email me @ anon@resnix.com , saying yes or no! I have a system that automatically splices email data and responds accordingly.
